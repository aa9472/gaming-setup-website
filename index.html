    KFC, or Kentucky Fried Chicken, was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. The first Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1952, with the first franchisee being Pete Harman. Colonel Sanders started KFC when he was 40 years old, and by the time of his death in the 1980s, he had built the world's most popular fast-food chain
.
The journey of KFC began in the 1930s when Harland Sanders refused to give up in the face of adversity. He identified the potential of restaurant franchising, which led to the opening of the first KFC franchise in 1952. The brand has since grown to have thousands of outlets in over 100 countries, with a menu tailored to each country's preference
